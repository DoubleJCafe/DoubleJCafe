<h1>Hi, I'm Josh! <br/>

<h2>üìù Summary:</h2>

I'am a highly motivated Computer Science student with a strong foundation in software development, data structures, and algorithms. My background as a Non-Commissioned Officer in the U.S. Army and Firefighter/EMT brings strong leadership, teamwork, and crisis management skills, along with a solid technical concept understanding. My passion for continuous learning enables me to easily adapt and be successful in dynamic, high-pressure environments where problem-solving abilities and technical expertise are leveraged in contributing toward team success.

<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Software Development Projects:</h2>

- <b>Capstone Project </b>
  - [Prediction Model - Mixed Martial Arts](https://github.com/vbabatchev/mma-prediction-model)
    - Our team developed a data-driven MMA competition prediction model. Using scraped UFC stats, we analyze competitor performance and generate an outcome predictions.

  - Our team developed a Figma prototype for a platform to help students assess course difficulty and workload before enrolling.
  - Goal of Project: Provide centralized, reliable information on course difficulty and workload through a user-centered design.
  - Key aspects of the project:
    - Created a Figma prototype to visualize the platform's user interface.
      ![figma](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a59cdeb2-0733-4ee5-97db-099440da188b)
    - Focused on learning usability engineering and applying user-centered design principles.
    - Allowed students to share detailed course information (difficulty, time commitment, etc.).
    - Implemented search and filtering functionalities for courses.
    - Enabled users to write reviews and rate courses on multiple criteria.
    - Incorporated privacy and authenticity measures (verified accounts, anonymous reviews).

- <b>Computer Graphics Modeling Project </b>
  - [AuditThisCourse](https://www.figma.com/proto/RIGnAim6zK1ccn9nM6ljo5/AuditThisCourse?node-id=312-341&t=59vZNcCnkZWAsHit-1&scaling=scale-down&page-id=312%3A249&starting-point-node-id=312%3A341)
  - Created a Solar System simulation using OpenGL, incorporating realistic planetary motions and Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion.
  - Goal of Project: Simulate the Solar System with realistic orbital mechanics and celestial bodies.
  - Key aspects of the project:
    - Used Kepler‚Äôs Third Law for orbital speed and position calculations.

    - Scaled planets and orbits according to real-world proportions.
    - Applied textures to all planets and the Sun, and made the Sun a point light source.
      ![Picture2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d9157e1-894c-4447-a00f-1d5be8db3f02)
    - Encapsulated the entire scene in a sphere with a starry background.
    - Implemented camera control using gluLookAt for proper positioning of the camera relative to moving objects.
    - Learned trial-and-error debugging in OpenGL, including managing transformations and camera angles.
    - Explored time-based calculations for dynamic positioning and movement of planets.

- <b>Database Design and Implementation Project </b>
  - Our team developed a database-driven web application for Space Academy, an institution tracking student enrollments, courses, professors, and departments.
  - Goal of Project: Manage and organize academic records for a space-themed university.
  - Key aspects of the project:
    - Designed an ERD and database schema to model students, courses, professors, enrollments, and departments.
    - Implemented M:N relationships using intersection tables (e.g., CourseEnrollments, ProfessorAssignments).
